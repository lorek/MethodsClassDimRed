# My ML Project
# @[University of Wrocław](https://math.uni.wroc.pl)

This is a sample machine learning project designed to demonstrate good coding practices in Python, including:

- **Modular Code Organization:** Functions and classes are separated into dedicated modules (e.g., in the `modules` folder).
- **Command-Line Argument Parsing:** The project uses `argparse` to allow flexible configuration.
- **Environment Management:** The project uses Conda to manage dependencies.
- **Data Handling:** Data is generated, saved (CSV, pickle), and loaded using dedicated utility modules.
- **Testing and Documentation:** A clear project structure and documentation facilitate code maintenance and reuse.

## Installation 




To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/my_ml_project.git
   cd my_ml_project
   ```
   
2. **Create the Conda Environment:**

Make sure you have Miniconda or Anaconda installed. Then run:
  ```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

Listing created environments:
  ```bash
conda conda env list
   ```

3. **Activate the Environment:**
```bash 
conda activate my_ml_project_env
```

## Usage 
Usage
The project is organized to promote good coding practices:

* **Modularization:** 
All helper functions and models are stored in the `modules` folder.

* **Argument Parsing:**
The main script (`main.py`) uses `argparse` to allow configurable options.

* **Data Handling:**
Data generation, saving, and loading are implemented in utility modules (e.g., `my_utils.py`).
To run the main script with default options, simply use:

To run the main script with default options, simply use:
```bash
python main.py
```

To see the available command-line options, use:
```bash
python main.py --help
```

This sample project serves as an example of how to structure a Python machine learning project, making it easy to maintain, extend, and reuse in larger projects.
